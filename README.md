# jsPortfolioSite

For this project I am showing off several other JavaScript programs that I've created over the past few months. 

This project uses Node.js, express, pug templates, and the command line to make it all come together. 

The project contains a JSON file where I wrote out all the key and value pairs to describe my previous projects. 

I had to setup my server, routes, and middleware by creating an app.js file. 

I have implemented error handling which will route a user to a 404 error if the path is missing or if the URL is bad.

Please view this project to get a sense of my previous work with HTML, CSS, JS, OOP, the DOM, API's JSON and Node.js!
